 ### Tradegoods ###
 ##################
 olives: "Olives"
 olivesDESC: "Olives are the fruit of the olive tree, an important crop all around the Mediterranean, both for the fruit itself but more importantly for the oil it yields, important as a source of fat in Mediterranean cuisine, of which milk had never been a big part due to early Roman influences. Olive trees take long to grow and are not very adaptible, so olive oil was primarily consumed around the Mediterranean."
 potatoes: "Potatoes"
 potatoesDESC: "The potato is the root of the poisonous nightshade plant, native to the Andes. While it was farmed in small amounts for millenia, it never spread the way corn did, being limited primarily to the Andes until the Europeans came. While the early Europeans brought some potatoes with them home, due to both laws and distrust of the poisonous plant it didn't catch on for some time in the Old World either. Only after a series of famines and diseases affecting wheat and barley in the 1700s, did the potato really catch on, becoming an essential recipe for the subsequent population growth across the Old World."
 citrus: "Citrus"
 citrusDESC: "Citrus is a genus of plants whose fruits are known for their predominantly bitter or sour tastes. Originally indigenous to Oceania, they spread to Asia with early civilization, and from there across the Old World. They didn't really catch on in Europe until the 1400s, but came to be considered a luxury treat - the sweet orange in particular. In the 1700s, when the idea that scurvy could be prevented with the consumption of citrus became more widespread, the fruits gradually increased in demand."
 cheese: "Cheese"
 cheeseDESC: "Cheese is a dairy product made from curdled milk, made primarily in Europe, India and West Asia. Unlike milk it is long-lived; some cheeses can be stored for years, making available the nutritional content of milk when and where it is not freshly available. Cheese came in many, many varieties, particularly in Europe, such that a French proverb held that 'there is a French cheese for every day of the year.' Cheese was not initially consumed in great amounts by the higher classes, being considered a food for the poor."
 horses: "Horses"
 horsesDESC: "Horses were prized as animals of labour, as transport, and were invaluable for warfare. Horses of the time were usually not known by specific breeds as much as their type, defined by their use; chargers (war horses), palfreys (riding horses), as well as draft- and pack horses. Many were also known by their region of origin; though this often applied to a selection of breeds from a particular area rather than a single one."
 beer: "Beer"
 beerDESC: "Beer and ale were the fermented drinks of choice in areas where grapes could not grow. Retaining the nutritional value of the grains used to make it, while being easier to make and store for longer periods of time than bread, as well as killing off many germs that could spread consumption of water, it was a very convenient drink, with the added benefit of alcohol's influence on one's mood. It was primarily made from barley, though other grains were used as well, and was often consumed by children as well due to the many nutritional benefits. Beer brewing had long been a home activity, but with innovations such as the introduction of hops to the process, it turned into large-scale commercial production."
 rum: "Rum"
 rumDESC: "Rum is made from sugar by-products, and its history dates back to antiquity, being long produced in India and West Asia. The first true rums however, were produced at sugar plantations in the Caribbean in the 1600s, and it quickly grew in popularity amongst the European settlers across the Americas. The increasing demands for rum helped push up the demand for sugar, one of the driving forces behind the evolving triangle trade."
 tar: "Tar"
 tarDESC: "Tar is a viscuous substance that can be obtained from various organic materials; primarily from pine trees, though tar-like products can be derived from various organic matter, like peat. Tar was a central part of North European and Colonial American economies, widely sought after as a preservative for wooden ships, protecting them against rot. It was also used for sealing ship hulls to make them waterproofs."
 marble: "Marble"
 marbleDESC: "Marble is a form of limestone that has since times immemorial been highly prized for use in sculpting and architecture all over the Old World, due to several properties of the stone: Relatively soft and easy to carve, but resistant to shattering, as well as offering a very distinct texture that helps bring statues to life. Its relative popularity among ancient Romans and Greeks also helped to keep it very popular in Europe through the Renaissance."
 glass: "Glassware"
 glassDESC: "Glass has always been important for humans, for use in architecture as regular windows, stained glass, in art, for cutlery, mirrors, jewelry, and so on. In Europe the center of glassmaking was the Venetian island of Murano."
 sulfer: "Sulfur"
 sulferDESC: "Sulfur, known to the ancient world as Brimstone, has long been associated with volcanic activity, which explains why ancient christians thought it might be of the devil. Sulfur was important in the production of gunpowder, being the ingredient most sought after."
 lead: "Lead"
 leadDESC: "Lead is a common, soft metal that is easy to extract and work with, and has been used for thousands of years. Lead was commonly used in alchemy, as well as for making bullets, being preferred over iron ammunition which damaged barrels more severely, as well as for its easier production."
 zinc: "Zinc"
 zincDESC: "Zinc is a blue-white lustrous metal that along with copper is used to make brass, commonly used to make figures, sculptures and tableware. Zinc was first isolated from its ores in India, centuries before the Europeans or Chinese managed the same, and most pure zinc in this period came from India."
 bronze: "Bronze"
 bronzeDESC: "Bronze is one of the oldest alloys known to man, having been refined since the 5th millennium BCE. Though it is no longer the go-to alloy for swords and shields, it is still a valuable material for many military purposes."
 steel: "Steel"
 steelDESC: "Steel is an alloy of iron, carbon and other elements, prized for its strength and resilience. Steelmaking dates back thousands of years, and it has a long history of use in smithing. Developments in the 1600s such as cementation and the making of crucible steel greatly expanded on steel's popularity and use."
 vanilla: "Vanilla"
 vanillaDESC: "Vanilla is a flavouring derived from vanilla orchids, native to South and Central America, primarily Mexico. Vanilla became popular in Europe as an additive to chocolate, a trend picked up from the Aztecs along with chocolate itslef . In the 1600s, vanilla-only sweets were made and quickly became immensely popular. Until the early modern era, vanilla was not cultivated outside its native range, due to its closely symbiotic nature with its main pollinator, a local bee species."
 paper: "Paper"
 paperDESC: "Paper is a thin material produced by pressing moist cellulose pulp derived from wood and grasses, then drying it. The result is a flexible sheet that can be used for writing, printing, cleaning, wrapping, and more. Invented in China at the start of the Common Era, and quickly adapted there for currency, it spread throughout Asia in the Middle Ages, eventually reaching Europe. With the advent of the printing press, the demand for paper in Europe skyrocketed."
 munitions: "Munitions"
 munitionsDESC: "Munitions represents military supplies; weapons, ammunition, equipment and so on."
 machinery: "Machinery"
 machineryDESC: "Machinery represents all kinds of items and goods needed to operate machinery, as well as pre-industrial constructions such as clockwork."
 uniforms: "Uniforms"
 uniformsDESC: "For as long as there have been professional militaries, there have been uniforms. Or at least there has been a soldier complaining about a lack thereof. Styilsh uniforms not only help distinguish troops on the battlefield, but also give a sense of national pride to all those who wear them."
 gunpowder: "Powder"
 gunpowderDESC: "Gunpowder, or black powder, is a chemical explosive consisting of sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter, with a wide range of uses - most of them involving war. Gunpowder has been used since its inception for firearms, rockets, fireworks, and as a blasting powder for mining and quarrying."
 brass: "Brass"
 brassDESC: "Brass is an alloy consisting primarily of Copper and Zinc, sometimes including marginal amounts of Lead, Aluminium, and Silicon. While Brass is often frivolously used for decorative purposes, it is invaluable in situations that require a spark not be struck, such as in the fittings of cannons."
 optics: "Optics"
 opticsDESC: "Telescopes were one of the most important inventions of the 17th century, allowing man to look upon the sky in greater detail than ever before. Even more important than science, though, is war - soon after their invention, telescopes became vital instruments for all navies."
 cinnamon: "Cinnamon"
 cinnamonDESC: "Cinnamon is produced from the bark of the cinnamon tree, and has been a valuable spice since it was first discovered. Europeans knew very little of the spice's origin for a long time, inventing such stories as that it was fished out of the sea at the end of the world. The island of Ceylon is now known as the origin of most Cinnamon produced throughout history."
 exotic_spices: "Exotic Spices"
 exotic_spicesDESC: "The term 'Exotic Spices' represents a wide range of spices that can only be found in the East Indies, such as Nutmeg and Cloves."
 leather: "Leather"
 leatherDESC: "Leather is a strong and ductile material produced from tanning animal skins, often cattle hide. It is used in the production of many valuable goods, such as clothing, books, armor, wallpaper, and furniture. A wide range of techniques are used across the world to produce many different varieties."

 BOOKBINDING: "Bookbinding"
 prices.32.t: "The Printing Revolution"
 prices.32.d: "The introduction of mechanical movable-type printing to Europe has changed the world - it may very well have been the most important invention in early-modern history. With books now so easily produced, demand for paper has skyrocketed, though we expect the market to normalize shortly."
 prices.32.a: "T h a n k   y o u , J o h a n n   G u t e n b e r g"
 PRINTINGPRESS: "The Printing Press"
 prices.33.t: "Prevalence of Vanilla"
 prices.33.d: "The production of Vanilla had long been confined to Mexico, but some adventurous merchants have discovered that it can be cultivated on Madagascar and the surrounding islands. This will greatly increase the supply of vanilla in the future, lowering its price."
 prices.33.a: "Perhaps we should have kept it in Mexico..."
 VANILLASPREAD: "Loss of Monopoly on Vanilla"
 prices.34.t: "Development of Steel Techniques"
 prices.34.d: "In the 1600s, tecniques such as the cementation process and later European advancement of the age-old crucible techniques practiced in other parts of the world, increased demand for and availability of steel."
 prices.34.a: "Ok."
 STEEL_DEVELOPMENT: "Advances in Steel Techniques"
 prices.35.t: "Spread of Pewter"
 prices.35.d: "Pewter, an alloy of mostly tin with some copper and lead, became popular for its resemblance to silver, while being much easier to produce. As a result, pewter became increasingly popular for use in plates, dishes, beer steins, lamps, and many other household items."
 prices.35.a: "I suppose we need something in place of silver, especially in this game..."
 PEWTER_POPULARIZED: "Spread of Pewter"
 prices.36.t: "Loss of Monopoly on Cinnamon"
 prices.36.d: "For centuries, the island of Ceylon has been the only source of cinnamon. But, as recent developments have shown, cinnamon can be cultivated elsewhere. The news of this discovery is sure to make its way around the world."
 prices.36.a: "Perhaps we shouldn't have done that..."
 CINNAMONSPREAD: "Loss of Monopoly on Cinnamon"
 prices.37.t: "Reinsheitgebot"
 prices.37.d: "In 1516, Duke Wilhelm IV of Bavaria introduced a new regulation regarding the production of beer: it was only to contain water, barley, and hops. The enactment of this law coïncided with the centralization of most beer production, which led to a general growth of the beer industry."
 prices.37.a: "Oans, zwoa, g'suffa!"
 BEER_INDUSTRY: "Reinheitsgebot"
 prices.38.t: "Sugar Molasses"
 prices.38.d: "While rum-like products had been produced in various areas of Asia since antiquity, it was only in the 17th century that plantation slaves discovered that molasses, a byproduct of sugar refining, could be fermended into alcohol. Rum production soon spread, and quickly became a staple of trans-Atlantic trade."
 prices.38.a: "Drink up, me hearties!"
 SUGAR_MOLASSES: "Sugar Molasses"
 prices.39.t: "Bank Notes"
 prices.39.d: "While paper money dates back to antiquity in China, paper representing currency only appeared in Europe around the 14th and 15th centuries, and even then it was not until the 18th century that a more permanent issue of bank notes became common. [Root.GetName] has begun a standardization of bank notes, surely other countries will follow suit."
 prices.39.a: "You're telling me we can just print more money?"
 BANKNOTES: "Bank Notes"
 prices.40.t: "Loss of Monopoly on Exotic Spices"
 prices.40.d: "Nutmeg, Cloves, and similar spices have long been confined to very few islands among the Moluccas, however, it has been found that they can grow on most of the islands in the East Indies. This will surely increase supply, while demand seems to be stagnant."
 prices.40.a: "Well, we weren't going to have -50% idea cost anyways."
 SPICESPREAD: "Loss of Monopoly on Exotic Spices"
 prices.43.t: "Lemons and Limes"
 prices.43.d: "Scurvy had always been a problem for navies, often taking the lives of more sailors than any actual warfare. However a physician in [Root.GetName] recently wrote a treatise suggeststing that scurvy was a dietary problem that could be fixed with regular intake of lemon or lime juice. While it took some time before eating citrus fruit became common practice to deal with scurvy, demand nonetheless increased."
 prices.43.a: "Call us limey all you want, at least we're healthy."
 REMOVE_SCURVY: "Lemons and Limes"
 prices.44.t: "Speltering"
 prices.44.d: "After thousands of years of smelting zinc ore with copper to produce brass, a new technique was finally discovered in the 16th century. By refining the zinc first, before smelting it with the copper, much more control over the ratio of zinc and copper could be gained, and a superior quality alloy could be produced. The demand for brass, and its constituent parts, has sharply risen due to this discovery."
 prices.44.a: "I suppose the world could always use more trumpets."
 BRASSMAKING: "Advanced Brassmaking"
 prices.49.t: "Expanded Munitions Industries"
 prices.49.d: "While other states have professional militaries, the [Root.GetAdjective] army commands a state.
