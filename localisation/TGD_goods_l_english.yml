 ### Tradegoods ###
 ##################
 olives: "Olives"
 olivesDESC: "Olives are the fruit of the olive tree, an important crop all around the Mediterranean, both for the fruit itself but more importantly for the oil it yields, important as a source of fat in Mediterranean cuisine, of which milk had never been a big part due to early Roman influences. Olive trees take long to grow and are not very adaptible, so olive oil was primarily consumed around the Mediterranean."
 potatoes: "Potatoes"
 potatoesDESC: "The potato is the root of the poisonous nightshade plant, native to the Andes. While it was farmed in small amounts for millenia, it never spread the way corn did, being limited primarily to the Andes until the Europeans came. While the early Europeans brought some potatoes with them home, due to both laws and distrust of the poisonous plant it didn't catch on for some time in the Old World either. Only after a series of famines and diseases affecting wheat and barley in the 1700s, did the potato really catch on, becoming an essential recipe for the subsequent population growth across the Old World."
 citrus: "Citrus"
 citrusDESC: "Citrus is a genus of plants whose fruits are known for their predominantly bitter or sour tastes. Originally indigenous to Oceania, they spread to Asia with early civilization, and from there across the Old World. They didn't really catch on in Europe until the 1400s, but came to be considered a luxury treat - the sweet orange in particular. In the 1700s, when the idea that scurvy could be prevented with the consumption of citrus became more widespread, the fruits gradually increased in demand."
 cheese: "Cheese"
 cheeseDESC: "Cheese is a dairy product made from curdled milk, made primarily in Europe, India and West Asia. Unlike milk it is long-lived; some cheeses can be stored for years, making available the nutritional content of milk when and where it is not freshly available. Cheese came in many, many varieties, particularly in Europe, such that a French proverb held that 'there is a French cheese for every day of the year.' Cheese was not initially consumed in great amounts by the higher classes, being considered a food for the poor."
 horses: "Horses"
 horsesDESC: "Horses were prized as animals of labour, as transport, and were invaluable for warfare. Horses of the time were usually not known by specific breeds as much as their type, defined by their use; chargers (war horses), palfreys (riding horses), as well as draft- and pack horses. Many were also known by their region of origin; though this often applied to a selection of breeds from a particular area rather than a single one."
 beer: "Beer"
 beerDESC: "Beer and ale were the fermented drinks of choice in areas where grapes could not grow. Retaining the nutritional value of the grains used to make it, while being easier to make and store for longer periods of time than bread, as well as killing off many germs that could spread consumption of water, it was a very convenient drink, with the added benefit of alcohol's influence on one's mood. It was primarily made from barley, though other grains were used as well, and was often consumed by children as well due to the many nutritional benefits. Beer brewing had long been a home activity, but with innovations such as the introduction of hops to the process, it turned into large-scale commercial production."
 rum: "Rum"
 rumDESC: "Rum is made from sugar by-products, and its history dates back to antiquity, being long produced in India and West Asia. The first true rums however, were produced at sugar plantations in the Caribbean in the 1600s, and it quickly grew in popularity amongst the European settlers across the Americas. The increasing demands for rum helped push up the demand for sugar, one of the driving forces behind the evolving triangle trade."
 tar: "Tar"
 tarDESC: "Tar is a viscuous substance that can be obtained from various organic materials; primarily from pine trees, though tar-like products can be derived from various organic matter, like peat. Tar was a central part of North European and Colonial American economies, widely sought after as a preservative for wooden ships, protecting them against rot. It was also used for sealing ship hulls to make them waterproofs."
 marble: "Marble"
 marbleDESC: "Marble is a form of limestone that has since times immemorial been highly prized for use in sculpting and architecture all over the Old World, due to several properties of the stone: Relatively soft and easy to carve, but resistant to shattering, as well as offering a very distinct texture that helps bring statues to life. Its relative popularity among ancient Romans and Greeks also helped to keep it very popular in Europe through the Renaissance."
 glass: "Glassware"
 glassDESC: "Glass has always been important for humans, for use in architecture as regular windows, stained glass, in art, for cutlery, mirrors, jewelry, and so on. In Europe the center of glassmaking was the Venetian island of Murano."
 sulfer: "Sulfur"
 sulferDESC: "Sulfur, known to the ancient world as Brimstone, has long been associated with volcanic activity, which explains why ancient christians thought it might be of the devil. Sulfur was important in the production of gunpowder, being the ingredient most sought after."
 lead: "Lead"
 leadDESC: "Lead is a common, soft metal that is easy to extract and work with, and has been used for thousands of years. Lead was commonly used in alchemy, as well as for making bullets, being preferred over iron ammunition which damaged barrels more severely, as well as for its easier production."
 zinc: "Zinc"
 zincDESC: "Zinc is a blue-white lustrous metal that along with copper is used to make brass, commonly used to make figures, sculptures and tableware. Zinc was first isolated from its ores in India, centuries before the Europeans or Chinese managed the same, and most pure zinc in this period came from India."
 bronze: "Bronze"
 bronzeDESC: "Bronze is one of the oldest alloys known to man, having been refined since the 5th millennium BCE. Though it is no longer the go-to alloy for swords and shields, it is still a valuable material for many military purposes."
 steel: "Steel"
 steelDESC: "Steel is an alloy of iron, carbon and other elements, prized for its strength and resilience. Steelmaking dates back thousands of years, and it has a long history of use in smithing. Developments in the 1600s such as cementation and the making of crucible steel greatly expanded on steel's popularity and use."
 vanilla: "Vanilla"
 vanillaDESC: "Vanilla is a flavouring derived from vanilla orchids, native to South and Central America, primarily Mexico. Vanilla became popular in Europe as an additive to chocolate, a trend picked up from the Aztecs along with chocolate itslef . In the 1600s, vanilla-only sweets were made and quickly became immensely popular. Until the early modern era, vanilla was not cultivated outside its native range, due to its closely symbiotic nature with its main pollinator, a local bee species."
 paper: "Paper"
 paperDESC: "Paper is a thin material produced by pressing moist cellulose pulp derived from wood and grasses, then drying it. The result is a flexible sheet that can be used for writing, printing, cleaning, wrapping, and more. Invented in China at the start of the Common Era, and quickly adapted there for currency, it spread throughout Asia in the Middle Ages, eventually reaching Europe. With the advent of the printing press, the demand for paper in Europe skyrocketed."
 munitions: "Munitions"
 munitionsDESC: "Munitions represents military supplies; weapons, ammunition, equipment and so on."
 machinery: "Machinery"
 machineryDESC: "Machinery represents all kinds of items and goods needed to operate machinery, as well as pre-industrial constructions such as clockwork."
 uniforms: "Uniforms"
 uniformsDESC: "For as long as there have been professional militaries, there have been uniforms. Or at least there has been a soldier complaining about a lack thereof. Stylish uniforms not only help distinguish troops on the battlefield, but also give a sense of national pride to all those who wear them."
 gunpowder: "Gunpowder"
 gunpowderDESC: "Gunpowder, or black powder, is a chemical explosive consisting of sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter, with a wide range of uses - most of them involving war. Gunpowder has been used since its inception for firearms, rockets, fireworks, and as a blasting powder for mining and quarrying."
 brass: "Brass"
 brassDESC: "Brass is an alloy consisting primarily of Copper and Zinc, sometimes including marginal amounts of Lead, Aluminium, and Silicon. While Brass is often frivolously used for decorative purposes, it is invaluable in situations that require a spark not be struck, such as in the fittings of cannons."
 optics: "Optics"
 opticsDESC: "Telescopes were one of the most important inventions of the 17th century, allowing man to look upon the sky in greater detail than ever before. Even more important than science, though, is war - soon after their invention, telescopes became vital instruments for all navies."
 cinnamon: "Cinnamon"
 cinnamonDESC: "Cinnamon is produced from the bark of the cinnamon tree, and has been a valuable spice since it was first discovered. Europeans knew very little of the spice's origin for a long time, inventing such stories as that it was fished out of the sea at the end of the world. The island of Ceylon is now known as the origin of most Cinnamon produced throughout history."
 exotic_spices: "Exotic Spices"
 exotic_spicesDESC: "The term 'Exotic Spices' represents a wide range of spices that can only be found in the East Indies, such as Nutmeg and Cloves."
 leather: "Leather"
 leatherDESC: "Leather is a strong and ductile material produced from tanning animal skins, often cattle hide. It is used in the production of many valuable goods, such as clothing, books, armor, wallpaper, and furniture. A wide range of techniques are used across the world to produce many different varieties."
 iron: "Iron"
 ironDESC: "Iron formed the basis of the metallurgical industry and was used extensively in the production of weapons and other military equipment."
 copper: "Copper"
 copperDESC: "Copper was the main component of bronze and was essential in the early production of cannons."
 furniture: "Furniture"
 fruitDESC: "furniture.desc"
 big_ship: "Ship of the Line"
 big_shipDESC: "Ships of the line were the biggest, toughest warships on the seas from the 17th to mid-19th century. In line-of-battle engagements, the heavier ship with the most powerful guns would almost always prevail, and thus ships of the line were feared and respected on the waters."

 CINNAMONSPREAD: "Loss of Monopoly on Cinnamon"
 prices.107.t: "Reinsheitgebot"
 prices.107.d: "In 1516, Duke Wilhelm IV of Bavaria introduced a new regulation regarding the production of beer: it was only to contain water, barley, and hops. The enactment of this law coïncided with the centralization of most beer production, which led to a general growth of the beer industry."
 prices.107.a: "Oans, zwoa, g'suffa!"
 BEER_INDUSTRY: "Reinheitsgebot"
 prices.108.t: "Sugar Molasses"
 prices.108.d: "While rum-like products had been produced in various areas of Asia since antiquity, it was only in the 17th century that plantation slaves discovered that molasses, a byproduct of sugar refining, could be fermented into alcohol.

 ADVENT_GUNPOWDER: "The Advent of Gunpowder"
 prices.112.t: "Artillery Cartridges"
 prices.112.d: "While artillery have been present on the battlefield for quite some time, their use has been limited - in no small part due to the difficulty in their loading. The invention of cartridges, the combination of shot and powder into a fabric bag, made the use of artillery much more practical.

 prices.114.t: "Speltering"
 prices.114.d: "After thousands of years of smelting zinc ore with copper to produce brass, a new technique was finally discovered in the 16th century. By refining the zinc first, before smelting it with the copper, much more control over the ratio of zinc and copper could be gained, and a superior quality alloy could be produced. The demand for brass and its constituent parts has sharply risen due to this discovery."
 prices.114.a: "I suppose the world could always use more trumpets."
 BRASSMAKING: "Advanced Brassmaking"
 prices.115.t: "The Watt Steam Engine"
 prices.115.d: "Developed in the later half of the 18th century, the Watt steam engine was the first type of steam engine equiped with a separate condenser, which was used to create a vacuum of sorts beneath the piston. The difference in pressure around the piston is what drove it into the cylinder. This new engine was more than twice as efficient than earlier variations, and its advent helped usher in the industrial revolution."

 WATT_STEAM: "Watt's Steam Engine"
 prices.116.t: "Synthetic Dyes"

 MUNITION_EXPANSION: "Expanded Munitions Industries"
 prices.118.t: "[Root.GetAdjective] Court Furniture"
 prices.118.d: "The majesty of a ruler is determined by the opulence of his court, everyone knows this. Recently an artisan by the name of André Boulle has come to our court with an array of cabinets with perfected inlays and stunning beauty. Naturally, we have awarded this master craftsman with the title of 'Master Cabinetmaker,' and have commissioned many pieces for our palace. If they have any wits about them, the other monarchs of the world will surely follow in the suit of the Court of [Root.GetName]."
 prices.119.t: "The Venetian Monopoly on Glass"
 prices.119.d: "The Glass business in Murano is booming now more than ever, and the always-scheming merchants of Venice have taken this opportunity to sieze a monopoly on the production of Glass. Through protectionism and secrecy is normally unbecoming of any free Republic, this sort of underhanded behavior is all-too-common in Venice, and they have successfully hidden their secrets of glassblowing perfection. Their control of Glass must not last."
 prices.119.a: "From this hour the independence of Venice has ceased to be..."
 prices.119.a.tt: "Until the Venetian Monopoly ends, we can only develop Glass if we are trading in it. The monopoly will be broken once Glass is developed by anyone, or if any one nation owns 5 provinces producing Glass."
 prices.120.t: "The End of the Venetian Monopoly on Glass"
 prices.120.d: "The weak, poor, and otherwise inept Venetians have proven unable to retain their monopoly on Glass. Their attempts to stop the flow of information out of Murano have failed, and the secrets of better glassblowing techniques have emerged, primarily concerning the production of mirrors. This is truly a great day for the world market."
 prices.120.a: "Good riddance. That's not how monopolies were supposed to work anyway."
