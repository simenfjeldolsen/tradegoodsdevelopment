 ### Tradegoods ###
 ##################
 olives: "Olives"
 olivesDESC: "Olives are the fruit of the olive tree, an important crop all around the Mediterranean, both for the fruit itself but more importantly for the oil it yields, important as a source of fat in Mediterranean cuisine, of which milk had never been a big part due to early Roman influences. Olive trees take long to grow and are not very adaptible, so olive oil was primarily consumed around the Mediterranean."
 potatoes: "Potatoes"
 potatoesDESC: "The potato is the root of the poisonous nightshade plant, native to the Andes. While it was farmed in small amounts for millenia, it never spread the way corn did, being limited primarily to the Andes until the Europeans came. While the early Europeans brought some potatoes with them home, due to both laws and distrust of the poisonous plant it didn't catch on for some time in the Old World either. Only after a series of famines and diseases affecting wheat and barley in the 1700s, did the potato really catch on, becoming an essential recipe for the subsequent population growth across the Old World."
 citrus: "Citrus"
 citrusDESC: "Citrus is a genus of plants whose fruits are known for their predominantly bitter or sour tastes. Originally indigenous to Oceania, they spread to Asia with early civilization, and from there across the Old World. They didn't really catch on in Europe until the 1400s, but came to be considered a luxury treat - the sweet orange in particular. In the 1700s, when the idea that scurvy could be prevented with the consumption of citrus became more widespread, the fruits gradually increased in demand."
 cheese: "Cheese"
 cheeseDESC: "Cheese is a dairy product made from curdled milk, made primarily in Europe, India and West Asia. Unlike milk it is long-lived; some cheeses can be stored for years, making available the nutritional content of milk when and where it is not freshly available. Cheese came in many, many varieties, particularly in Europe, such that a French proverb held that 'there is a French cheese for every day of the year.' Cheese was not initially consumed in great amounts by the higher classes, being considered a food for the poor."
 horses: "Horses"
 horsesDESC: "Horses were prized as animals of labour, as transport, and were invaluable for warfare. Horses of the time were usually not known by specific breeds as much as their type, defined by their use; chargers (war horses), palfreys (riding horses), as well as draft- and pack horses. Many were also known by their region of origin; though this often applied to a selection of breeds from a particular area rather than a single one."
 beer: "Beer"
 beerDESC: "Beer and ale were the fermented drinks of choice in areas where grapes could not grow. Retaining the nutritional value of the grains used to make it, while being easier to make and store for longer periods of time than bread, as well as killing off many germs that could spread consumption of water, it was a very convenient drink, with the added benefit of alcohol's influence on one's mood. It was primarily made from barley, though other grains were used as well, and was often consumed by children as well due to the many nutritional benefits. Beer brewing had long been a home activity, but with innovations such as the introduction of hops to the process, it turned into large-scale commercial production."
 rum: "Rum"
 rumDESC: "Rum is made from sugar by-products, and its history dates back to antiquity, being long produced in India and West Asia. The first true rums however, were produced at sugar plantations in the Caribbean in the 1600s, and it quickly grew in popularity amongst the European settlers across the Americas. The increasing demands for rum helped push up the demand for sugar, one of the driving forces behind the evolving triangle trade."
 tar: "Tar"
 tarDESC: "Tar is a viscuous substance that can be obtained from various organic materials; primarily from pine trees, though tar-like products can be derived from various organic matter, like peat. Tar was a central part of North European and Colonial American economies, widely sought after as a preservative for wooden ships, protecting them against rot. It was also used for sealing ship hulls to make them waterproofs."
 marble: "Marble"
 marbleDESC: "Marble is a form of limestone that has since times immemorial been highly prized for use in sculpting and architecture all over the Old World, due to several properties of the stone: Relatively soft and easy to carve, but resistant to shattering, as well as offering a very distinct texture that helps bring statues to life. Its relative popularity among ancient Romans and Greeks also helped to keep it very popular in Europe through the Renaissance."
 glass: "Glassware"
 glassDESC: "Glass has always been important for humans, for use in architecture as regular windows, stained glass, in art, for cutlery, mirrors, jewelry, and so on. In Europe the center of glassmaking was the Venetian island of Murano."
 tin: "Tin"
 tinDESC: "Tin, a corrosion-resistant metal was a central part of bronze, alongside copper. It was also used for military purposes. Perhaps most importantly, tin could be mixed with antimony and lead to make pewter, a metal that resembled silver but was much cheaper. Pewter was the main material for tableware in Europe until porcelain could be manufactured."
 lead: "Lead"
 leadDESC: "Lead is a common, soft metal that is easy to extract and work with, and has been used for thousands of years. Lead was commonly used in alchemy, as well as for making bullets, being preferred over iron ammunition which damaged barrels more severely, as well as for its easier production."
 zinc: "Zinc"
 zincDESC: "Zinc is a blue-white lustrous metal that along with copper is used to make brass, commonly used to make figures, sculptures and tableware. Zinc was first isolated from its ores in India, centuries before the Europeans or Chinese managed the same, and most pure zinc in this period came from India."
 mercury: "Mercury"
 mercuryDESC: "Mercury is a metal with the unique property of being liquid at room temperature. It is a fairly rare metal, found mostly in cinnabar deposits, where it has bonded with sulphur. Mercury was thought to have medicinal properties, despite exposure in fact leading to adverse health effects. It was used in ointments and cosmetics, and alchemists considered mercury the First Matter, from which all others were formed."
 steel: "Steel"
 steelDESC: "Steel is an alloy of iron, carbon and other elements, prized for its strength and resilience. Steelmaking dates back thousands of years, and it has a long history of use in smithing. Developments in the 1600s such as cementation and the making of crucible steel greatly expanded on steel's popularity and use."
 vanilla: "Vanilla"
 vanillaDESC: "Vanilla is a flavouring derived from vanilla orchids, native to South and Central America, primarily Mexico. Vanilla became popular in Europe as an additive to chocolate, a trend picked up from the Aztecs along with chocolate itslef . In the 1600s, vanilla-only sweets were made and quickly became immensely popular. Until the early modern era, vanilla was not cultivated outside its native range, due to its closely symbiotic nature with its main pollinator, a local bee species."
 paper: "Paper"
 paperDESC: "Paper is a thin material produced by pressing moist cellulose pulp derived from wood and grasses, then drying it. The result is a flexible sheet that can be used for writing, printing, cleaning, wrapping, and more. Invented in China at the start of the Common Era, and quickly adapted there for currency, it spread throughout Asia in the Middle Ages, eventually reaching Europe. With the advent of the printing press, the demand for paper in Europe skyrocketed."
 munitions: "Munitions"
 munitionsDESC: "Munitions represents military supplies; weapons, ammunition, equipment and so on."
 machinery: "Machinery"
 machineryDESC: "Machinery represents all kinds of items and goods needed to operate machinery, as well as pre-industrial constructions such as clockwork."
 uniforms: "Uniforms"
 uniformsDESC: "A uniform is a type of clothing worn by members of an organization while participating in that organization's activity."

 COMMERCIAL_WHALING: "Commercial Whaling"
 prices.37.t: "Brewing Industries"
