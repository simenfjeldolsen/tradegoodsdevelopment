 ### Tradegoods ###
 ##################
 barley: "Barley"
 barleyDESC: "Barley is hardier than wheat, requiring less water to grown, so it was grown in harsher climates. Partially due to this, and its less favourable taste, barley and its products was more commonly consumed by the poor. Like the other grains, straw was an important by-product of barley, used for making baskets, mats, shoes and thatching."
 rye: "Rye"
 ryeDESC: "Rye is even hardier than barley, able to survive in the cold climates and poorer soils of the north, capable of surviving the winter. Rye bread could also be kept for months without getting moldy, but it was much chewier, with a stronger taste, than other breads, so rye was not very popular, common primarily in areas too cold for other grains to grow."
 maize: "Maize"
 maizeDESC: "Maize, often called corn, was a staple crop of the Americas; primarily in Central America, where growth conditions were ideal but also spreading to the rest of the Americas. It served the same role for Americans as most European cereals; a staple crop for humans and animals, used for straws and fermented beverages. European settlers brought corn home, and it spread to the rest of the world thanks to its ability to survive in diverse climates."
 rice: "Rice"
 riceDESC: "Rice was domesticated from wild grains in China, and from there spread as a staple crop to most of East Asia, where it grew plentifully and conditions were favourable. Requiring lots of water, rice was typically grown in paddies or terraces, and required better irrigation systems than most crops. By the Middle Ages, rice had spread to most of the Muslim world as well, and was grown even in Italy."
 millet: "Millet"
 milletDESC: "Millet has a short growing season and is growable in drier climates, making it a staple crop across the semiarid tropics as well as some colder, drier regions. There are two main varieties; pearl millet, grown in Africa and India, and broomyard millet, grown in Northern China."
 sorghum: "Sorghum"
 sorghumDESC: "Sorghum, also known as durra, is an extremely hardy crop, capable of surviving longer periods of droughts, even producing some seeds during such periods. It was grown in arid areas in Africa and Central Asia, but also in India, North Africa and Spain, and was a staple in areas where the dry climate prevented the growing of most other crops."
 olives: "Olives"
 olivesDESC: "Olives are the fruit of the olive tree, an important crop all around the Mediterranean, both for the fruit itself but more importantly for the oil it yields, important as a source of fat in Mediterranean cuisine, of which milk had never been a big part due to early Roman influences. Olive trees take long to grow and are not very adaptible, so olive oil was primarily consumed around the Mediterranean."
 palm_oil: "Palm Oil"
 palm_oilDESC: "Palm oil is an edible oil harvested from the thereafter-named oil palm. Found primarily in West Africa, it was long popular for its high fat content and the good taste it gave when food was prepared with it. It was an important trade product as well; traders from both Europe and East Africa would frequently buy palm oil when visiting West African cities."
 potatoes: "Potatoes"
 potatoesDESC: "The potato is the root of the poisonous nightshade plant, native to the Andes. While it was farmed in small amounts for millenia, it never spread the way corn did, being limited primarily to the Andes until the Europeans came. While the early Europeans brought some potatoes with them home, due to both laws and distrust of the poisonous plant it didn't catch on for some time in the Old World either. Only after a series of famines and diseases affecting wheat and barley in the 1700s, did the potato really catch on, becoming an essential recipe for the subsequent population growth across the Old World."
 citrus: "Citrus"
 citrusDESC: "Citrus is a genus of plants whose fruits are known for their predominantly bitter or sour tastes. Originally indigenous to Oceania, they spread to Asia with early civilization, and from there across the Old World. They didn't really catch on in Europe until the 1400s, but came to be considered a luxury treat - the sweet orange in particular. In the 1700s, when the idea that scurvy could be prevented with the consumption of citrus became more widespread, the fruits gradually increased in demand."
 opium: "Opium"
 opiumDESC: "Opium is a latex derived from the opium poppy, originally native to West and Central Asia, spread via trade routes such as the Silk Road to much of the Old World, though in large parts of Europe it was not used much, considered a 'muslim medicine'. China later enacted similar proihibitions, which combined with British trade eventually led to the conflicts known as the Opium Wars. Opium is a strong narcotic, and was used since prehistory in medicinal, spiritual and recreational contexts. Parts of the poppy plant - the seeds in particular - can be used in food as well."
 livestock: "Livestock"
 livestockDESC: "Keeping livestock for meat and milk is a practice as old as civilization itself. Except pigs, livestock was usually valued more for their labour and other products such as milk, wool and manure for fertilizer, being slaughtered only once they reached old age. The resulting meat was not of a high quality; the raising of animals specifically for finer meat was more resource- and labour-intensive, making meat more of a luxury reserved for those who could afford it. Perhaps just a common source of meat, however, was game; animals hunted for their meat (as well as products such as furs and bone). Hunting was also a common social activity amongst the higher classes."
 cheese: "Cheese"
 cheeseDESC: "Cheese is a dairy product made from curdled milk, made primarily in Europe, India and West Asia. Unlike milk it is long-lived; some cheeses can be stored for years, making available the nutritional content of milk when and where it is not freshly available. Cheese came in many, many varieties, particularly in Europe, such that a French proverb held that 'there is a French cheese for every day of the year.' Cheese was not initially consumed in great amounts by the higher classes, being considered a food for the poor."
 horses: "Horses"
 horsesDESC: "Horses were prized as animals of labour, as transport, and were invaluable for warfare. Horses of the time were usually not known by specific breeds as much as their type, defined by their use; chargers (war horses), palfreys (riding horses), as well as draft- and pack horses. Many were also known by their region of origin; though this often applied to a selection of breeds from a particular area rather than a single one."
 apiculture: "Apiculture"
 apicultureDESC: "Apiculture is the art of beekeeping; keeping colonies of bees in order to harvest various producs of their hives; honey primarily but also wax, pollen and royal jelly. Uses of these products food, flavouring, preservatives, candle-making and, in the case of the bees themselves, pollinating crops. Beekeeping was practiced all over the Old World, and even in the Americas the Mayan people domesticated bees."
 whaling: "Whaling"
 whalingDESC: "Whaling is the practice of hunting whales primarily for their blubber, which could turned into oil for use in cosmetics, candle-making or leather-making. It was also a source of nutrition, along with the actual meat of the whale. Whaling was not very commonly practiced,taking place mostly in Japan, Norway and various Inuit communities, as well as the Basques, who were the first to practice commercial whaling, bringing it with them to the colonies in Northeast America."
 beer: "Beer"
 beerDESC: "Beer and ale were the fermented drinks of choice in areas where grapes could not grow. Retaining the nutritional value of the grains used to make it, while being easier to make and store for longer periods of time than bread, as well as killing off many germs that could spread consumption of water, it was a very convenient drink, with the added benefit of alcohol's influence on one's mood. It was primarily made from barley, though other grains were used as well, and was often consumed by children as well due to the many nutritional benefits. Beer brewing had long been a home activity, but with innovations such as the introduction of hops to the process, it turned into large-scale commercial production."
 rum: "Rum"
 rumDESC: "Rum is made from sugar by-products, and its history dates back to antiquity, being long produced in India and West Asia. The first true rums however, were produced at sugar plantations in the Caribbean in the 1600s, and it quickly grew in popularity amongst the European settlers across the Americas. The increasing demands for rum helped push up the demand for sugar, one of the driving forces behind the evolving triangle trade."
 cashmere: "Cashmere"
 cashmereDESC: "Cashmere is a very fine goat's wool, manufactured since antiquity in regions of Mongolia, Nepal anmd Kashmir (from whence it gets its name). In the 1400s the production of cashmere was made into a more proper industry by Zain-ul-Abidin, the then-ruler of Kashmir. It became highly popular for its fine texture compared to other wools."
 camel: "Camels"
 camelDESC: "Camels were domesticated and used by humans in desert areas where other animals have a hard time surviving, requiring very little water for extended periods of time. They were used for warfare, as labour animals, for transport, warfare, milk and meat, and their hairs were a prized export product for use in textiles. There are two species of camel, both of which were domesticated during this age: The bactrian (two-humped) camel native to the Gobi, and the dromedary (one-humped) camel, native to the Middle East and parts of Africa. In addition there are other members of the genus, the alpaca and llama, native to the Andes."
 linen: "Linen"
 linenDESC: "A textile made from the flax plant, it is one of the oldest textiles, used by humans since prehistory. It was a popular material for sails and clothing, as well as being used for table covers, sheets, drapery and so on."
 hemp: "Hemp"
 hempDESC: "Native to much of Asia, hemp has been used since prehistory for many purposes: Smoking its leaves for medicine or recreational purposes, using its seeds for oil, stalks for clothing, sails and tents, paper, and so on. Perhaps most important in the Age of Sail however, was its use in rope-making."
 leather: "Leather"
 leatherDESC: "Leather is created by a long process known as tanning. It is used for many purposes including clothing, belts, shoes, book-covers, as bags for carrying drink, and even as parchment for writing on."
 tar: "Tar"
 tarDESC: "Tar is a viscuous substance that can be obtained from various organic materials; primarily from pine trees, though tar-like products can be derived from various organic matter, like peat. Tar was a central part of North European and Colonial American economies, widely sought after as a preservative for wooden ships, protecting them against rot. It was also used for sealing ship hulls to make them waterproofs."
 lumber: "Lumber"
 lumberDESC: "Lumber in its many forms has been an integral part of building and ship construction for ages, and demand was always on the increase during this age, as fleets grew ever larger and more impressive. The forests of Northern Europe were a prime source of lumber until the wide forests of North America were made accessible to the European markets; colonisation in America was in part to secure direct access to this vital resource as Europe became increasingly deforested."
 sandal: "Sandal"
 sandalDESC: "Sandal is a heavy, yellowish wood, native to India and Oceania, highly sought-after for use in carving, as well as its purported medicinal properties, owing its strong fragrance, which also made it popular in perfumes and incense."
 ebony: "Ebony"
 ebonyDESC: "Ebony is a very dense wood found in semitropical areas in Africa, India and Indonesia. It yields a very distinct wood, hard and dark, with a smooth finish that when polished can resemble stone. It was therefore highly sought-after for use in carving and various ornamental purposes."
 mahogany: "Mahogany"
 mahoganyDESC: "Mahogany is a red-brown wood native to the Caribbean and Central America. While exports were initially slow, European colonies in the Caribbean and Central America became, by the 1700s, major exporters of the wood, popular for its durability and workability. It was commonly used to make furniture, but also ships due to its rot resistance and musical instruments owing to being a tonewood (a wood claimed to have good acoustic properties)."
 teak: "Teak"
 teakDESC: "Teak is a large, decidious tree, native to India and Indochina, whose wood is valued for its durability and water resistance. It was sought after for use in ship building and construction."
 bloodwood: "Logwood"
 bloodwoodDESC: "Logwood, also known as bloodwood, named for its intense, red colour, and native to Mexico and Central America, was sought after for its use as a versatile, fine red dye, that when combined with irons could also proudce hard-to-come-by black dyes."
 woad: "Woad"
 woadDESC: "Since antiquity woad was gathered and cultivated in Europe as a source of blue dyes. Once trade routes opened to India and made true indigo more accessible, the European woad industry survived only through strictly enforced regulations and laws, alongside claims that indigo was corrosive and caused yarn to rot, being called the 'Devil's Dye'. Eventually however, woad was outcompeted by the superior quality of indigo."
 carmine: "Carmine"
 carmineDESC: "Carmine is a red dye made from either cochineal or kermes, both kinds of insects which are harvested and crushed to release carminic acid. The acid acts as a pigment that provides a deep, rich scarlet color when applied to clothing or food. Both cochineal and kermes are very rare and their dye greatly prized by clothmakers. In Europe, Polish Cochineal and Portuguese Kermes provided most red dye before the Spanish conquest of Mexico, when cheaper Aztec cochineal made its way to European markets."
 marble: "Marble"
 marbleDESC: "Marble is a form of limestone that has since times immemorial been highly prized for use in sculpting and architecture all over the Old World, due to several properties of the stone: Relatively soft and easy to carve, but resistant to shattering, as well as offering a very distinct texture that helps bring statues to life. Its relative popularity among ancient Romans and Greeks also helped to keep it very popular in Europe through the Renaissance."
 glass: "Glassware"
 glassDESC: "Glass has always been important for humans, for use in architecture as regular windows, stained glass, in art, for cutlery, mirrors, jewelry, and so on. In Europe the center of glassmaking was the Venetian island of Murano."
 obsidian: "Obsidian"
 obsidianDESC: "Obsidian is a shiny, black, volcanic glass which since antiquity was used for tool-making due to the sharp edges it could hold. Due to its relative rarity, being found only in volcanic areas, desire for obsidian formed one of the earliest incentives for trade. By the 1400s obsidian was not utilized much in the Old World, but Pre-Columbian American civilizations, particularly in Mesoamerica, utilized it extensively for trade, tools and art."
 jade: "Jade"
 jadeDESC: "Jade is the common name for two types of metamorphic rock; jadeite and nephrite, both of which have a green hue to them. Jade was abundant in China, where it was used extensively for decorative purposes; sculptures, figures and jewelry. In Europe jade was extremely rare and expensive, but was believed to have medical properties."
 carpet: "Carpet"
 carpetDESC: "A carpet is any loom-woven, felted textile or grass floor covering. The hand-knotted pile carpet probably originated in Central Asia between the 3rd and 2nd millennium BC. Carpet-making was introduced to Spain in 10th century by the Moors. The Crusades brought Turkish carpets to all of Europe, where they were primarily hung on walls or used on tables. Only with the opening of trade routes in the 17th century were significant numbers of Persian rugs introduced to Western Europe."
 silver: "Silver"
 silverDESC: "Silver has been mined since ancient times, long valued as a precious metal, used to make ornaments, jewelry, high-value tableware and utensils (hence the term silverware) and currency coins."
 gems: "Gems"
 gemsDESC: "A gemstone is a piece of mineral, which, in cut and polished form, is used to make jewelry or other adornments. Gemstones are valued for their aesthetic properties such as lustre and colour, and include a variety of stones such as diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, rubies, but also materials such as amber. Most are fairly rare, which is in part what lent value to them."
 tin: "Tin"
 tinDESC: "Tin, a corrosion-resistant metal was a central part of bronze, alongside copper. It was also used for military purposes. Perhaps most importantly, tin could be mixed with antimony and lead to make pewter, a metal that resembled silver but was much cheaper. Pewter was the main material for tableware in Europe until porcelain could be manufactured."
 lead: "Lead"
 leadDESC: "Lead is a common, soft metal that is easy to extract and work with, and has been used for thousands of years. Lead was commonly used in alchemy, as well as for making bullets, being preferred over iron ammunition which damaged barrels more severely, as well as for its easier production."
 zinc: "Zinc"
 zincDESC: "Zinc is a blue-white lustrous metal that along with copper is used to make brass, commonly used to make figures, sculptures and tableware. Zinc was first isolated from its ores in India, centuries before the Europeans or Chinese managed the same, and most pure zinc in this period came from India."
 mercury: "Mercury"
 mercuryDESC: "Mercury is a metal with the unique property of being liquid at room temperature. It is a fairly rare metal, found mostly in cinnabar deposits, where it has bonded with sulphur. Mercury was thought to have medicinal properties, despite exposure in fact leading to adverse health effects. It was used in ointments and cosmetics, and alchemists considered mercury the First Matter, from which all others were formed."
 coal: "Coal"
 coalDESC: "Coal is a combustible rock that has been mined since antiquity, used as a fuel source in homes and to run smelters. In China it was said to be so plentiful people could take several hot baths every week. In Europe, Britain was the main source of coal, one of many reasons it became the driving force behind the Industrial Revolution, as steam machines relied heavily on coal for fuel. Coal was also used to make gunpowder."
 steel: "Steel"
 steelDESC: "Steel is an alloy of iron, carbon and other elements, prized for its strength and resilience. Steelmaking dates back thousands of years, and it has a long history of use in smithing. Developments in the 1600s such as cementation and the making of crucible steel greatly expanded on steel's popularity and use."
 sulphur: "Sulphur"
 sulphurDESC: "Sulphur is a yellow chemical that was used for preserving food, producing paper and gunpowder, and it even had decorative uses. Natural deposits occur near hot springs and volcanoes, making sulphur gathering a strenuous task. Highly flammable, it was a core ingredient in gunpowder, and it was used extensively in medicine, particularly skin treatments."
 cinnamon: "Cinnamon"
 cinnamonDESC: "Cinnamon is a spice that originates from the inner bark of two different species of tree, the 'true' cinnamon native to Sri Lanka, and the Chinese cinnamon (also known as cassia) native to China but grown in other parts of East Asia. Cinnamon was used since ancient times in Asia, but remained a luxury in Europe. The rise of the Ottoman Empire blocked much of the cinnamon trade and was a key factor in driving Europeans to seek a sea route around Africa."
 nutmeg: "Nutmeg"
 nutmegDESC: "Nutmeg and mace are spices derived from the same tree, indigenous to only the small island chain of Banda in the Moluccas. They were highly prized for their vlaue as flavouring, as well as a medicinal and preservative agent. The Dutch and British East India companies competed for a long time to gain control of the island and thus the only known source of nutmeg. In the 1800s, trees were taken from the island and planted elsewhere, notably Sri Lanka, Singapore, Zanzibar and Grenada in the Caribbean."
 clove: "Clove"
 cloveDESC: "Clove is a spice native to the Moluccas in Indonesia, obtained from the flower buds of an indigenous tree. Clove was popular not only as a spice but also in various Asian medicinal traditions."
 saffron: "Saffron"
 saffronDESC: "Saffron is a spice derived from the stigmas of the crocus flower. Unlike many other spices, saffron was cultivated in Europe as well as Asia, however it declined in popularity when more exotic goods such as tea, coffee, chocolate and vanilla became available. Even so, saffron has remained, throughout history, one of the world's most costly substances, primarily because it is a very labour-intensive crop: Tens of thousands of crocus flowers must be grown, cared for and hand-picked to get even a single pound of saffron."
 vanilla: "Vanilla"
 vanillaDESC: "Vanilla is a flavouring derived from vanilla orchids, native to South and Central America, primarily Mexico. Vanilla became popular in Europe as an additive to chocolate, a trend picked up from the Aztecs along with chocolate itslef . In the 1600s, vanilla-only sweets were made and quickly became immensely popular. Until the early modern era, vanilla was not cultivated outside its native range, due to its closely symbiotic nature with its main pollinator, a local bee species."
 ginger: "Ginger"
 gingerDESC: "Ginger is a flowering plant whose root is valued for both its flavour, and use in traditional folk medicine - it was widely considered an aphrodisiac - as well as in spiritual contexts."
 paper: "Paper"
 paperDESC: "Paper is a thin material produced by pressing moist cellulose pulp derived from wood and grasses, then drying it. The result is a flexible sheet that can be used for writing, printing, cleaning, wrapping, and more. Invented in China at the start of the Common Era, and quickly adapted there for currency, it spread throughout Asia in the Middle Ages, eventually reaching Europe. With the advent of the printing press, the demand for paper in Europe skyrocketed."
 jewelry: "Jewelry"
 jewelryDESC: "Jewelry are small, decorative items for personal adornment, such as rings, necklaces, earrings, bracelets and so on. Often made from precious metals or inlaid with precious stones, jewelry dats back as long as human tool use, with 70 000 year old shell jewelry having been found in Africa."
 munitions: "Munitions"
 munitionsDESC: "Munitions represents military supplies; weapons, ammunition, equipment and so on."
 machinery: "Machinery"
 machineryDESC: "Machinery represents all kinds of items and goods needed to operate machinery, as well as pre-industrial constructions such as clockwork."

 manual_dev_title: "§gDevelop Tradegoods in Province§!"
 manual_dev_desc: "This decision lets you change the tradegoods in a province. \n\n§YHow do I do this?§!\n§l To change tradegoods in a province, you must build the Prepare Tradegood Development building in the province you want. It requires ADM tech 10, costs 200 ducats, takes 12 months to build, and can be built regardless of how many existing buildings you have in a province. §!\n\n NB! It can only be built it in one province at a time, otherwise you will not be able to control where development happens. Since the building takes a year to finish, make sure you are building it in the correct desired province.\n\n§lTo build it in a province, you need to own at least one other province producing the same tradegood as the one in the target province (i.e. you must own two provinces in total producing that tradegood) §!- three for grains!\n\n After firing this decision, an event will pop up that lets you change the tradegood in the province. You cannot select every good in every province - it depends on climate, terrain, existing tradegoods, development, and so on. Furthermore some tradegoods, like metals, only have a chance at succeeding at changing the tradegood, but they instantly refund §G200§! ducats, and you will get a partial refund of any further expenses, if you do not succeed. \n\n§!§lMouse over the §g(?)§! for further explanation.§!"
 manual_dev_explanation: "§YWhat can I develop?§!\n--§lYou can always promote basic crops (in their respective climates) like grains, potatoes, hemp, and olives, as well as wool. \n--From basic grains you can develop other crops and food products, like wine, tea (and other plantation goods), beer or livestock, and from livestock you can develop horses, cheese or leather.\n--From wool, linen and fur you can develop cloth, and from cloth, silks and rugs. \n--In hills and mountains you can prospect for ores or precious metals, which you can develop into steel or jewelry, respectively. \n--In forests you can promote the lumber industry, or gather tar (as well as in marshes), both of which, along with hemp and linen, can be developed into naval supplies. \n--In coastal provinces you can focus on fisheries, which can then develop into naval supplies or whaling. \n--Nations with overseas territories can directly promote various plantations, spices or tropical woods in appropriate provinces. \n--In highly developed provinces, you can promote paper, glassworking or, later on, more advanced industries such as armaments, furniture and machinery. \n--Sometimes you need the right climate, terrain, region or level of development in addition to a relevant tradegood. There are many other possible links than the ones above, for you to figure out...§!\n\n§Y As a final note on what you can develop where, keep in mind that since you need to have 2 or 3 of a good to develop away from it in your provinces, some of the 'top tier' goods can not be developed in many provinces, unless you are a very large nation.§!\n\n It will always incur a cost to change the tradegood, this depends on a combination of terrain and climate, the type of tradegood, development in the province, and so on, and usually varies from §R5§! to §R25§! of each type of monarch point (depending on the type of good), and §R50§! to §R500§! ducats (depending on other factors). You will see your tradegood change (or fail to change) immediately after making your selection, and you cannot change a tradegood again for §Y30§! years after having done so. If you have a manufactory, you will always lose it, but be refunded §G500§! ducats so you can rebuild it."
